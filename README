NAME
     nb -- simple notebook manager

SYNOPSIS
     nb [n|new] file_name.md
     nb [s|sync]

DESCRIPTION
     The nb provides a lightweight interface for accessing and adding notes on
     command line.

     nb doesn't complain much and tries to work with what is available.
     fzf(1) is used for fuzzy searching and it is launched by default if no
     options are given.

     In the case of fzf unavailability, nb simply changes directory to NB_PATH

     If [sync] option is used, nb attempts a add/commit/push cycle on NB_PATH
     via git(1)

ENVIRONMENT
     NB_PATH  The location of your notebook folder.
